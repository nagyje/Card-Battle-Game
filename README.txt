On your turn you will have the choice to play either a creature card or a spell card.

Every card has a mana value that determines the cost of the card. 

You can play as many Creatures or Spells as you can afford.

After choosing the cards you want to play you can pick the target that each card will effect.

When your turn ends the opponent will then take their turn.

This continues until either you or your opponent have 0 hp left.
